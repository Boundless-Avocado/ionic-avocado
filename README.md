# GuacFriends

#### Meetup on the Fly

GuacFriends is the easiest way to form groups of common interest & invite your group to join you at any time. Get SMS invitations when others want to do the activity.

* You don't need to remember who told you they're interested.
* Everyone can manage their own membership to join and leave.
* No need to RSVP or create calendar events.
* You can control it with the web client, SMS, or email!

## Development

### Requirements

- Node.js

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install
sudo npm install -g bower nodemon
bower install
```

### Configuring API Keys

You'll need API keys to connect to Twilio and Sendgrid. Send us a message for ours or sign up for their free trials. To configure the keys, run these commands from the terminal:

```sh
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=keyhere;
export TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=keyhere;
export SENDGRID_API_USER=keyhere;
export SENDGRID_API_KEY=keyhere;
```

### Running the Server

From within the root directory:

```sh
nodemon
```

It should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
