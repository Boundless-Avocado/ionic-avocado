There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Boundless Avocado

## Sub-Heading ##
  Create and join groups that you are interested in, then invite others to join you.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  Boundless Avocado is the easiest way to form groups of common interest, then invite your group to join you in that activity at any time. Get SMS invitations when others want to do the activity. You don't need to remember who told you they are interested, everyone can manage their own membership to join and leave. No need to RSVP or create calendar events.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  It's very difficult to organize groups of people.
  Some events of interest are not the type of events you can plan well in advance.
  It's hard to remember who said they are interested.
  It's hard to reach out to more than a few people all at once.
  We don't have enough people to participate in an activity. We don't want to be lonely.


## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

Create groups of common people and notify them when there's an activity they want to do.
Our product is easier than the existing solutions because it works over SMS to be very lightweight to get started with and use.
